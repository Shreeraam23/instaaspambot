# Instagram Auto DM Bot (Controlled via Telegram)

This bot allows you to send automated Instagram DMs using the `instagrapi` library, with a Telegram bot as the control interface. It enables sending messages to multiple recipients while maintaining compliance with rate limits.

## Features
- **Login via Telegram**: Securely log in to your Instagram account through a Telegram bot.
- **Send Mass DMs**: Send messages to multiple users in a controlled manner.
- **Avoid Rate Limits**: Uses delays between actions to reduce detection risk.
- **Easy Setup**: Requires only Python, `instagrapi`, and Telegram Bot API.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `instagrapi` for Instagram automation
- `pyTelegramBotAPI` for Telegram bot functionality
- `dotenv` (optional) for environment variable management

3. Set up a Telegram bot:

## Usage

   python bot.py
   ```
2. Open Telegram and interact with your bot.
3. Send `/login` to authenticate your Instagram account.

5. To send bulk messages, use `/send_bulk <message>` (ensure recipient list is predefined).

## Important Notes
